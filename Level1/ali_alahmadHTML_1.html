        <b>Technology</b> is a <q>very amazing thing</q> 
        that <i>scientists</i> create. 
        <u>Scientists</u> look at all the things 
        that we as human beings will need in our lives, then make a cool gadget or object.For example, scientists knew thatwe needed a way to communicate with each other even when we are  not together.</blockquote>Because of this, they created a telephone which we can use to talk to other people even when we are not with them.    </p>
